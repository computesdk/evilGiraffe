# ðŸ¦’ Evil Giraffe

> Open-source AI chat. Local-first. Questionably supervised.

## What Evil Giraffe Will Be

When it's ready, Evil Giraffe will be:

- A clean, fun, non-technical way to run powerful AI on your own machine
- 100% local: no data sent to the cloud, the feds, or anyone named Michael
- Packed with features like multi-model switching, chat saving, and a UI that doesnâ€™t make your eyes bleed

It's for writers, tinkerers, curious humans, and people who fear giraffes but also distrust the cloud.

## Current Status

All done. Go ahead and download. Make sure that you have downloaded Ollama from their website.

## How to Install Evil Giraffe

Download the .zip file from GitHub and extract it to a folder of your choice. Open launcher.exe and get chatting.

## Reporting Issues

Go ahead. I will probably never look at them, but go ahead.

## In Summary

This is Evil Giraffe.

Iâ€™m tired.

Garrisonâ€™s making another startup tomorrow.

Have fun.
