# 🦒 Evil Giraffe
Open-source AI chat. Local-first. Questionably supervised.

🛑 STOP. You can't actually download this app yet. It's not ready. Nothing works. Everything is broken. Especially me. Go away.





What Evil Giraffe Will Be
When it’s ready, Evil Giraffe will be:

A clean, fun, non-technical way to run powerful AI on your own machine

100% local: no data sent to the cloud, the feds, or anyone named Michael

Packed with features like multi-model switching, chat saving, and a UI that doesn’t make your eyes bleed

It’s for writers, tinkerers, curious humans, and people who love giraffes but also distrust the cloud.

Important:
You cannot use this app yet. It's under active development by one unpaid intern (me) and creatively guided by Garrison, who is entirely to blame.

Current Status
Not even close.
This project is pre-alpha, pre-release, and possibly pre-sanity. You can clone it, but don’t expect much more than some folders, vague ambition, and TODO comments.

If you're here because Garrison sent you a link, please know this is part of a vision. The code will catch up eventually. Probably.

How to Install Evil Giraffe
You don’t.

There is no installation yet. If you’re trying to install this, you’re either:

A time traveler

Garrison pretending to be a VC

One of those people who opens GitHub and immediately yells “Why doesn’t this work???” in the Issues tab

Which brings us to...

Reporting Issues
Please don’t.
If you open an issue on this unfinished repo, I will assume you:

Didn’t read anything above

Deserve to stub your toe on a Lego

Are, in fact, Garrison, testing me

Issues will be closed with prejudice. Possibly with memes. Definitely with sarcasm.



In Summary
This is Evil Giraffe.

You can’t use it yet.

I’m tired.

Garrison’s making another startup tomorrow.

If you file a bug report, I will throw you into the metaphorical savannah.
