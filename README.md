# 🦒 Evil Giraffe

> Open-source AI chat. Local-first. Questionably supervised.

## 🛑 STOP

You can't actually download this app yet. It's not ready. Nothing works. Everything is broken. Especially me. Go away.


## What Evil Giraffe Will Be

When it's ready, Evil Giraffe will be:

- A clean, fun, non-technical way to run powerful AI on your own machine
- 100% local: no data sent to the cloud, the feds, or anyone named Michael
- Packed with features like multi-model switching, chat saving, and a UI that doesn’t make your eyes bleed

It's for writers, tinkerers, curious humans, and people who fear giraffes but also distrust the cloud.

## Important

You cannot use this app yet. It's under active development by one unpaid intern (me) and creatively guided by Garrison, who is entirely to blame.

## Current Status

Not even close.

This project is pre-alpha, pre-release, and possibly pre-sanity. You can clone it, but don’t expect much more than some folders, vague ambition, and TODO comments.

If you're here because Garrison sent you a link, please know this is part of a vision. The code will catch up eventually. Probably.

## How to Install Evil Giraffe

You don’t.

There is no installation yet. If you’re trying to install this, you’re either:

- A time traveler
- Garrison pretending to be a VC
- One of those people who opens GitHub and immediately yells “Why doesn’t this work???” in the Issues tab

## Reporting Issues

Please don’t.

If you open an issue on this unfinished repo, I will assume you:

- Didn't read anything above
- Deserve to step on a Lego
- Are, in fact, Garrison, testing me

Issues will be closed with prejudice. Possibly with memes. Definitely with sarcasm.

## In Summary

This is Evil Giraffe.

You can’t use it yet.

I’m tired.

Garrison’s making another startup tomorrow.

If you file a bug report, I will throw you into the savannah with the giraffes.
