                </div>
            <p>Congratulations, curious human. You've stumbled upon Evil Giraffe, the internet's most charmingly suspicious AI playground.

                <li>💾 Save your chats so you can re-read the time your AI gave life advice at 3AM</li>
                <li>🔁 Switch between models faster than a caffeinated squirrel</li>

                <h2>Why “Evil Giraffe”?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Because “Suspiciously Intelligent Tall Horse” didn’t test well with focus groups.
                <br>
                Also, just like a giraffe in a hoodie, our platform is a little weird, totally unexpected, and very cool once you get to know it.</p>

                <h3>Do I Need to Be a Hacker?</h3>
                <p>Nope. If you can click buttons and type words, you’re already overqualified. Evil Giraffe was made for actual people, not just basement-dwelling keyboard warriors (no offense, Garrison).</p>

                <h2>Is My Data Safe?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Yes. Nothing leaves your machine. Not your chat history. Not your model downloads. Not even that time you asked an AI how to flirt.</p>

                    <li>Chat – Ask questions. Get answers. Get weird results. We can't see them.</li>
                    <li>Save – Keep the good convos. Trash the weird ones. Or don’t—we’re not judging.</li>
                    <li>Switch – Swap models like you're trading Pokemon cards.</li>
                </ul>
